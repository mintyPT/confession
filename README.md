# Confession

Helper to extract confessions (information) from webpages.

## Code Example

For now, check the tests.

## Motivation

I was tired of coding multiple times the same logic for scrappers so I put some of it inside a small package. It's nothing new, just helpful.

## Installation

```npm i -S confession```

## API Reference

For now, check the tests.

## Tests

```npm run test```

## Contributors

I created this mostly for me but I hope it might be useful for others too, so pull requests are welcome and if you find a problem don't hesitate to open an issue or message me [@mauro_goncalo](http://twitter.com/mauro_goncalo)
